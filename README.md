Re-writing my first Minecraft-Processing repo

Decided to re-do my last yearâ€™s project because there were a ton of issues with it, this year I am planning to add Polymorphic block classes, chunk systems, layered Perlin noise and block face optimisations in addition to textures. I will still be sticking with Processing as I am getting the most control over the events in my clone.
